Although the concept of force predates Newton 's law \, there was no mathematical definition of force before Newton . The principle of least action -LRB- or principle of stationary action -RRB- \, Schroedinger equation \, Heisenberg uncertainty principle \, causality and a few other laws also fall into this category -LRB- of mathematical definitions -RRB- .
Nor should ` physical law ' be confused with ` law of physics ' - the term ` physical law ' usually covers laws in other sciences -LRB- e.g. biology -RRB- as well .
The production of a summary description of nature in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of science .
Empirical laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific experiments over many years \, and which have become accepted universally within the scientific community .
A physical law \, scientific law \, or a law of nature is a scientific generalization based on empirical observations of physical behavior .
Laws of nature are distinct from the law \, either religious or civil \, and should not be confused with the concept of natural law .

The agent in the vaccine stimulates the body 's immune system to recognize the agent as foreign \, destroy it \, and `` remember '' it . Then the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms that it later encounters .
The microneedle \, which is `` pointed projections fabricated into arrays that can create vaccine delivery pathways through the skin '' .
While the majority of vaccines are dead \, inactivated or attenuated organisms \, purified products derived from them \, some vaccines are synthetic vaccines .
Possible methods include liposomes and ISCOM -LRB- immune stimulating complex -RRB- .
Cultured mammalian cells are expected to become increasingly important \, compared to conventional options such as chicken eggs \, due to greater productivitity and few problems with contamination .
Many vaccines have been highly cost effective and beneficial for public health .
Sometimes \, this is because the host 's immune system simply does not respond adequately or at all .
In some instances \, wild populations may be vaccinated .
Combination vaccines are expected to reduce the quantities of antigens they contain \, and thereby decrease undesirable interactions \, by using pathogen-associated molecular patterns .
Where rabies occurs \, rabies vaccination of dogs may be required by law .
Adjuvants usually boost immune response .
A monovalent vaccine is designed to immunize against a single antigen or single microorganism .
A multivalent vaccine is designed to immunize against two or more strains of the same microorganism \, or against two or more microorganisms .
Although controversial claims have been made that thiomersal contributes to autism \, no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims .
In 1950s the polio vaccine was developed .
Both animals kept as pets and animals raised as livestock are routinely vaccinated .
Vaccine production techniques are evolving .
Vaccines may be monovalent or multivalent .
The number of vaccines actually administered has risen dramatically in recent decades .
For example \, the experimental vaccine CYT006-AngQb has been investigated as a possible treatment for high blood pressure .
Some religious groups do not allow uses of vaccines \, and some political groups oppose mandatory vaccination on the grounds of individual liberty .
Most vaccine development to date has relied on governments \, universities and non-profit organizations .
In certain cases a monovalent vaccine may be preferable for rapidly developing a strong immune response .
The filing of patents on vaccine development processes can be viewed as an obstacle to the development of new vaccines .
With an oral vaccine \, there is no risk of blood contamination .
Physiotherapy clinics are run by physiotherapists \, psychology clinics run by clinical psychologists \, and so on for each type of health care .

Her work on cancer epidemiology was carried on by Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill . They published `` Lung Cancer and Other Causes of Death In Relation to Smoking .
Nicolaes Tulp believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads . He said that it was contagious .
Over the past 50 years \, great efforts have been made on collecting data across medical practice \, hospital \, provincial \, state \, and even country boundaries . This data is used to study the sharing dependence of environmental and cultural causes on cancer incidence .
With the microscope \, it was discovered that the ` cancer poison ' spread from the one tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites -LRB- `` metastasis '' -RRB- .
Cancer treatment became dependent on the individual art of the surgeon at removing a tumor \, except for William Coley . In the late 1800s \, Coley felt that the rate of cure after surgery had been higher before asepsis .
The work of other physicians led to different views . Physicians then started working together .
Cancer can sometimes be treated using radiotherapy -LRB- also called radiation therapy -RRB- \, chemotherapy \, or immunotherapy -LRB- also called biological therapy -RRB- .
The oldest known description and surgical treatment of cancer was discovered in Egypt . It dates back to approximately 1600 B.C. .
British surgeon Percivall Pott was the first to find a cause for cancer . In 1775 \, he discovered that cancer of the scrotum was a common disease among chimney sweeps .
The well known Scottish surgeon Alexander Monro saw only 2 breast tumor patients out of 60 surviving surgery for two years .
He later added - oma after the word . It is Greek for swelling .
Some of the most common include breast cancer \, brain cancer \, leukemia \, testicular cancer \, mesothelioma \, and lung cancer .
With radiation also came the first signs of multi-disciplinary approaches to cancer treatment .
The patient 's treatment was made up of diet \, blood-letting \, and\\/or laxatives . The treatment was according to the patient 's humor .
The use of surgery to treat cancer had poor results . This was because of problems with hygiene .
In the 19th century \, asepsis made surgical hygiene better . As the survival statistics went up \, surgical removal of the tumor became the primary treatment for cancer .
Hippocrates named many kinds of cancer .
He stated that the removal should be radical and that all diseased tissue should be removed . This included the use of amputation or the removal of veins running in the direction of the tumor .
In the 16th and 17th centuries \, it became more acceptable for doctors to dissect bodies to discover the cause of death .
Richard Doll left the London Medical Research Center -LRB- MRC -RRB- . He left to start the Oxford unit for Cancer epidemiology in 1968 .
In Greek \, oncos means swelling . He called malignant tumors carcinos .
Some of the most common include breast cancer \, brain cancer \, leukemia \, testicular cancer \, mesothelioma \, and lung cancer . Breast cancer begins in the breast .
Modern epidemiological methods are closely related to current ideas of disease and public health policy .
The veins of the cut surface of solid malignant tumor looks like a crab : `` the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet \, whence it derives -LRB- gets -RRB- its name '' .
This changed during World War II . This is when medical research centers found that there were large international differences in disease incidence .
He called malignant tumors carcinos . This means crab or crayfish in Greek .
The German professor Wilhelm Fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct .
Hippocrates only described and made drawings of tumors he saw from outside . This is because the Greeks did not open up the body .
The surgeon was no longer operating in isolation . The surgeon worked together with hospital radiologists to help patients .
She published a comparative study in 1926 . It was about 500 breast cancer cases and 500 control patients .
The Papyrus describes eight cases of ulcers of the breast . They were treated by cauterization .
This made a process of putting all of the patient data into hospital files . This led to the first statistical patient studies .
The writing says about the disease \, `` There is no treatment . ''
The humor theory describes four bodily fluids -LRB- black \, yellow bile \, blood \, and phlegm -RRB- .
A Second Report on the Mortality of British Doctors '' followed in 1956 -LRB- otherwise known as the British doctors study -RRB- .
He also recommended the use of cauterization for the area treated if necessary .
Through the centuries it was discovered that cancer could occur anywhere in the body . The humor theory treatment was popular until the 19th century with the discovery of cells .
The Dutch professor Francois de la Boe Sylvius believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes . He believed that acidic lymph fluid was the cause of cancer .
Another very early surgical treatment for cancer was described in the 1020s . It was described by Avicenna -LRB- Ibn Sina -RRB- in The Canon of Medicine .
The age of cellular pathology was born .
The Japanese medical community found that the bone marrow of victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was completely destroyed .
This view of the disease was first made clear by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan . He made it known between 1871 and 1874 .
This idea made national public health bodies to make it possible to bring together health data across practices and hospitals . Many countries use this process today .
With the use of computers \, the unit was the first to bring together large amounts of cancer data .
They in turn were made up of millions of cells . This laid rest the humor-theories about chemical imbalances in the body .
They said that diseased bone marrow could also be destroyed with radiation . This led to the discovery of bone marrow transplants for leukemia .
At the end of the 19th century \, Marie Curie and Pierre Curie discovered radiation . They had found the first non-surgical cancer treatment .

The remains of the storm were later taken in by a warm front around 2 am EDT -LRB- 0600 UTC -RRB- .
Around 7:30 pm EDT -LRB- 2330 UTC -RRB- \, a QuikSCAT satellite flew over the depression and found tropical storm-force winds . But the NHC thought the depression did n't strengthen and that winds were affected by rain .
The National Hurricane Center also reported that Tropical Depression One was also the farthest north a May tropical cyclone has ever formed .
Then on 8 pm EDT -LRB- 0000 UTC on May 28 -RRB- \, the NHC stopped monitoring the storm \, as the low was not expected to strengthen anymore .
At 5:00 pm EDT -LRB- 2100 UTC -RRB- \, the NHC gave out its last advisory on Tropical Depression One .
When the storm became Tropical Depression One on May 28 \, it was the third time since 1851 that an Atlantic tropical cyclone formed before June 1 \, the official start of an Atlantic hurricane season . The depression followed Subtropical Storm Andrea of May 2007 and Tropical Storm Arthur of May 2008 .
The first time this event happened was in 1932 \, 1933 \, and 1934 ; the second time it happened was in 1951 \, 1952 \, and 1953 .
On May 28 \, the NHC started to monitor the storm again and on 11:00 am EDT -LRB- 1500 UTC -RRB- \, they declared the storm to be a tropical cyclone and named it Tropical Depression One . At that time \, the storm 's location was about 310 mi -LRB- 500 km -RRB- south of Providence \, Rhode Island .
After a quick burst of convection during the night \, thunderstorm clouds inside the depression started to disappear by 3:00 am EDT -LRB- 0700 UTC -RRB- .
On May 29 \, the depression almost became a tropical storm \, when the storm 's strength was measured at T2 .5 \, or 40 mph -LRB- 65 km\\/h -RRB- using the Dvorak technique . But some of the measurements were also low as T1 .5 \, which was the reason why the NHC did n't call it a tropical storm .
On May 27 \, the storm was 120 miles -LRB- 195 km -RRB- south of Cape Hatteras \, North Carolina when the National Hurricane Center -LRB- NHC -RRB- decided to start monitoring the storm .

On 1 July 2006 the number of ambulance trusts fell from 29 to 13 .
Emergency medical services in the United Kingdom are provided by one of the four National Health Services through local ambulance services \, known in England and Wales as trusts .
This service is most often called on during major incidents \, when there is a high level of staff absence or when there is an unusually high call volume \, although in some areas \, voluntary crews are regularly used to supplement full time trust cover .
Both organizations have also provided cover for the public when NHS ambulance trust staff have held strikes or walk outs .
The main activity of the organizations apart from training and education \, is providing ambulance cover at events \, as an extension of their First aid contract .
Some organisers use a private firm instead of a voluntary ambulance service because of wider availability during the week -LRB- sometimes difficult for a voluntary service to cover -RRB- or for a wider range of skills \, such as provision of qualified Paramedics .

Total damage is thought to be at about $ 150 million -LRB- 2008 USD -RRB- .
The cell is now no longer useful to the virus \, therefore it must find a new host .
During this time \, the virus will not produce any copies \, it will remain inactive until external stimuli -LRB- such as light or stress -RRB- prompts it into activation \, or the redtart of the life cycle .
It is only active when reproducing within a host \, using a hosts ' resources and food .
One of the ways a virus can be seen as living is that a virus needs to make more of themselves .
Some viruses can `` hide '' inside another cell \, either to defend itself against the host cell defenses or immune system \, or because it is not in the best interest of the virus to make more copies at the time .
After a virus has made many copies of itself \, it usually has used up the cell 's resources .
Permissibility determines how the infection will progress .
Attachment \, or adsorption \, occurs between the viral part and the host cell membrane .
In order for the virus to make copies and infect \, it must enter cells of the host animal and use those cells ' materials .
The process by viral copies are released to find new hosts \, is called shedding .
After control is taken by the virus and the environment is set for the virus to begin making copies of itself \, replication occurs quickly .
It is usually only after a virus enters a host that it can gain access to cells in order to invade .
It is at this stage a distinction between susceptibility and permissibility of a host cell is made .
Next \, a virus must take control of the host cell 's replication mechanisms .
This is the final stage in the viral life cycle .
In order to enter the cells \, proteins found on the surface of the virus interact with proteins of the cell .
This hiding is called latency .
A virus can not survive on its own .
Viruses are near the same to living organisms \, however there are differences .
Once inside a host \, a virus 's main purpose is to make as many copies of itself \, and infect other host cells ; everything it does is to benefit its fitness and increase the number of its offspring .
It is often associated with playing tennis \, golf or other kinds of sport that use a racquet .

The older way of viral culture has been replaced by shell vial culture \, in which the sample is spun onto a single layer of cells and viral growth is measured by antigen detection ways .
If the cells show changes \, known as cytopathic effects \, then a culture is positive \, meaning the test indicates infection .
A Viral culture is a laboratory test in which the virus samples are placed with a cell medium that the virus being tested for is able to infect .
This shortens the time to detection for slow growing viruses such as cytomegalovirus \, for which the method was developed .
Set in 1957 \, this fourth movie in the Indiana Jones movie series and is based around an older and wiser Indiana Jones -LRB- played by Harrison Ford -RRB- against agents of the Soviet Union -- led by Spalko -LRB- Cate Blanchett -RRB- -- for the crystal skull .
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a 2008 adventure movie directed by Steven Spielberg .
Duodenal ulcers are peptic ulcers in the duodenum .
The depression moved onto land at St. Catherines Island \, Georgia \, and it quickly weakened .
Other rainfall totals of 2 to 3 in -LRB- 50 to 75 mm -RRB- were common .
At Georgetown County \, South Carolina \, officials watched the storm closely .
Moving through an area of cool water temperatures \, as well as unfavorable upper-level winds \, the depression was not able to get winds greater than 35 mph -LRB- 55 km\\/h -RRB- \, and as a result did not gain tropical storm status .
At first \, the depression moved west-northwest at about 13 mph -LRB- 20 km\\/h -RRB- \, and most of the convection from the storm was separated from the center .
The system was caught in an environment characterized by high surface pressures .
However \, flood watches were issued for part of Georgia and South Carolina .
There were no damages or casualties because of this depression .
The storm continued to move northwestward for its whole life \, from the steering currents of a subtropical ridge and an approaching mid-level trough .
Early on July 26 \, it moved onto land on St. Catherines Island \, Georgia \, and after slowly weakening over land \, it died out on July 27 .
However \, the cloud pattern became organized \, and was made up of a number of curved banding features .
The depression was never predicted to become tropical storm status . Because of this \, no tropical storm warnings or watches were issued .
The depression formed on July 25 from the same tropical wave that created another weather system .
According to surface and satellite observations \, it is thought that the system became Tropical Depression Seven at 1200 UTC on July 25 about 60 miles -LRB- 95 km -RRB- east of Daytona Beach \, Florida .
Before landfall \, the highest winds were measured to exist in a small area northeast of the center of circulation \, where a well-defined group of clouds persisted .
It was a small and disorganized depression \, and it never became a tropical storm \, which is stronger than a tropical depression .
The depression dropped light to moderate rain from Florida to the coast of North Carolina . The highest rain was 5.17 inches -LRB- 131 mm -RRB- in Savannah \, Georgia .
Because the storm was weak \, the effects were limited to heavy rain in Florida \, Georgia \, South Carolina and North Carolina .
Tropical Depression Seven was a weak tropical depression that formed near the northeast Florida coast . It was the seventh tropical cyclone of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season .
A tropical wave \, which had also created Tropical Depression Six \, combined itself with an upper-level low pressure area to create an area of deep convection near Hispaniola on July 23 \, 2003 .
Testicular cancer has one of the highest cure rates of all cancers ; more than 90 % .
In the United States \, about 8\,000 to 9\,000 people are diagnosed with testicular cancer every year .
Even in the small number of cases where the cancer has spread widely \, chemotherapy offers a cure rate of at least 50 % .
Every male has a 1 in 250 -LRB- four tenths of one percent \, or 0.4 % -RRB- chance of being diagnosed with it .
Testicular cancer is a type of cancer that develops in one or both testicles \, a part of the male reproductive system .

Non-chemical remedies include cooling \, warming \, soft stimulation .
Itch -LRB- Latin : pruritus -RRB- is an unpleasant sensation that leads to the desire or reflex to scratch .
Pain creates a reflex withdrawal while itch leads to a scratch reflex .
Often \, however \, scratching can intensify itching and even cause further damage to the skin \, dubbed the `` itch-scratch-itch cycle '' .
Sometimes scratching relieves isolated itches \, hence the existence of devices such as the back scratcher .
Some plant products have been found to be effective anti-pruritics \, others not .
Itch has many similarities to pain and both are unpleasant sensory experiences but their behavioral response patterns are different .
Methane is the main part of what we commonly refer to as natural gas .
Cold seeps change the shape of the ocean floor over time \, where reactions between methane and seawater create carbonate rock formations and reefs .
Other kinds of cold seeps are :
The cyclone itself had no effect on land \, and did not cause any damage .
The remains of Tropical Depression Ten helped to form Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas on August 23 .
The depression slowly moved towards the west \, and wind shear made it so the storm could not gain much more strength .
The tropical depression began as a tropical wave that entered the Atlantic Ocean on August 8 \, 2005 .
The depression formed on August 13 from a tropical wave that entered the Atlantic Ocean on August 8 .
Tropical Depression Twelve later became Hurricane Katrina .
Late on August 13 \, a weather forecaster said that it was `` beginning to look like Irene-junior '' . They said this because it was undergoing mid-level shear towards southwest `` beneath the otherwise favorable upper-level outflow pattern '' .
At the time \, it was located about 1600 m to the east of Barbados .
Because of strong wind shear \, the depression stayed weak and did not strengthen much .
Tropical Depression Ten did not impact land . Because of this \, no tropical cyclone watches and warnings were given out .
Tropical Depression Ten was the tenth tropical cyclone of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season .
The system formed into Tropical Depression Ten at 1200 UTC on August 13 .
Instead \, it developed the following chart :
The President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports â '' a study group sponsored by the United States Government â '' declines to offer a simple definition of physical fitness .
Physical fitness has two components : general fitness -LRB- a state of health and well-being -RRB- and specific fitness -LRB- the ability to perform specific aspects of sports or occupations -RRB- .

An emergency exit in a building is an exit for emergencies \, such as a fire .
Some people use toothpicks to try to remove trapped food from between the teeth and other people use dental floss to try to do this . Dental floss is very often recommended by dentists as safe for flossing teeth \, so it is probably safe to remove food from between the teeth using dental floss \, since it is more or less the same activity as flossing is .
It is important to floss before brushing teeth and to floss at least once a day .
Dental floss is a special type of thread .
